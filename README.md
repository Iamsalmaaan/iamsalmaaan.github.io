### What I learned
Div Positioning and Spacing: One of the critical aspects of this project was managing the spacing and positioning of `div` elements. I experimented with different CSS properties such as `margin`, `padding`, `flexbox`, and `position` to align elements exactly as per the design.

- Responsiveness: Ensuring that the QR code generator was responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes was another crucial learning point. I utilized media queries to adjust layouts and make sure that the application looks good on both desktop and mobile views.

- Practical CSS Techniques: I deepened my understanding of various CSS techniques, including text shadows, box shadows, and border radius, which enhanced the visual appeal of the application.
